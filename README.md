## Hi, there!

I'm Veronika, a girl from the Czech Republic who is learning to code in the Canadian wilderness. I create visuals. I design and write code. Years of experience in marketing, advertising, and photography have led me to programming itself, and I've decided to expand my horizons into frontend development.

This is my coding diary.
